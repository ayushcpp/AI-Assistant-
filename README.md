🐍 Create Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended ✅)

I strongly recommend creating a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

🔹 Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
🔹 Mac / Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

After activation, your terminal should look like this:

(.venv)
📦 Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not available, install manually:

pip install fastrtc gradio-client requests
▶️ Run The Project
python main.py
🌐 Important Step After Running

When you run the project, your terminal will generate an HTTPS link.

👉 Hold CTRL and click on the HTTPS link in the terminal.
It will open in your browser.

Then just enjoy the project 🎉
